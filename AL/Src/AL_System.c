 * @brief   RCC HAL module driver.
 *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following
 *          functionalities of the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral:
 *           + Initialization and de-initialization functions
 *           + Peripheral Control functions
 *

 ==============================================================================
 ##### RCC specific features #####
 ==============================================================================
 [..]
 After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator
 (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache
 and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
 SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
 (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
 all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
 (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
 (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
 are assigned to be used for debug purpose.

 [..]
 Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
 (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
 (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
 (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings
 (+) Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
 (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
 (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
 derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)

 ##### RCC Limitations #####
 ==============================================================================
 [..]
 A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral
 enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write
 from/to registers.
 (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
 (+) If peripheral is mapped on AHB: the delay is 2 AHB clock cycle
 after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register
 (+) If peripheral is mapped on APB: the delay is 2 APB clock cycle
 after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register

 [..]
 Possible Workarounds:
 (#) Enable the peripheral clock sometimes before the peripheral read/write
 register is required.
 (#) For AHB peripheral, insert two dummy read to the peripheral register.
 (#) For APB peripheral, insert a dummy read to the peripheral register.
